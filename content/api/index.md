### About the REST API

The SaaSquatch REST API is organized around [REST](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer). Our API is designed to have predictable, resource-oriented URLs and to use HTTP response codes to indicate API errors. We use built-in HTTP features, like HTTP authentication and HTTP verbs, which can be understood by off-the-shelf HTTP clients. [JSON](http://www.json.org/) will be returned in all responses from the API, including errors.

### REST API Benefits

The SaaSquatch REST API provides a powerful, highly flexible, and highly customizable way of connecting your application with SaaSquatch. 

With the SaaSquatch API you can tailor your referral program to fit the specifics of your product and business model. 

### Using the SaaSquatch REST API

Each API method in the reference includes a full list of the available arguments (both required and optional), and exmaple cURL request, details of the structure of the response, and a complete example of the JSON response.
