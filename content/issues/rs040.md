### Tips To Fix This

 - Check that you have correctly connected your payment provider account to your SaaSquatch tenant on the [install](/success/using-referral-saasquatch/#install) or [integrations](/success/navigating-the-portal/#integrations) page in the Portal.
 - Check that have registered a valid payment provider customer ID for the user in SaaSquatch
 - Check that you payment provider is not experiencing an outage.

### Why is This Happening?

This error is most commonly the result of a misconfiguration of your programs connection to your payment provider. This is often the result of your Payment Provider credentials no longer being valid, or having been revoked.

This error can also be the result of incorrect information about a referral participant having been registered with SaaSquatch, which is then used to lookup an account in your Payment Provider which does not exist, or is invalid.
