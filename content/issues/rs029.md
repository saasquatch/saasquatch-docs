### Tips To Fix This

 - Make sure that you are trying to set the `payment_provider_id` for the correct `account_id`.
 - Make sure you're using the right value for `payment_provider_id`.

### Why is This Happening?

Once an account has had it's `payment_provider_id` set to something other then `null` the `payment_provider_id` value cannot be updated.
You're receiving this error because a different `account_id` already has its`payment_provider_id` set to the same value you are trying to push.
