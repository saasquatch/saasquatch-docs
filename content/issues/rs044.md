### Tips To Fix This

 - Check that you are including a valid `accountId`.
 - Check that you are not including the `accountId` as an empty parameter when you do not plan to set a `accountId`.

### Why is This Happening?

If you are encountering this error it means that you are attempting to lookup/upsert a registered user in SaaSquatch wihtout all of the required information. The accountId of the user is one of the required parameters needed in order to perform this type of call.
