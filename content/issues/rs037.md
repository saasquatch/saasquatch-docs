### Tips To Fix This

 - Check that you are including a valid value for `engagementMedium`. These include `POPUP` and `EMBED`.

### Why is This Happening?

`POPUP` and `EMBED` are currently the two ways to display a widget using the `engagementMedium` pamrameter in our squatch.js V2 Library.

More information about the `engagementMedium` parameter can be found in our [squatch.js Library Reference](/developer/squatchjs/v2/reference/).
