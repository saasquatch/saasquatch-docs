### Tips To Fix This

 - Make sure that the email address is atleast 7 characters long
 - The email address must have characters before the @ symbol
 - The Top Level Domain needs to be at least 2 characters (.ca for example)

### Why is This Happening?

The email address SaaSquatch receives seems to be invalid. Please verify that the email address you are sending through [Squatch.js](/squatchjs/) is a valid email address.
