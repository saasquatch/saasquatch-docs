### Tips To Fix This

 - Check that you are including the locale in the format `language_COUNTRY`. eg. `en_CA`, `fr_FR`
 - Check that you are not including the parameter `locale` when you are not intending to set the value.

### Why is This Happening?

Language codes are defined by [ISO 639](http://www.loc.gov/standards/iso639-2/php/code_list.php) that assigns two- and three-letter codes to most languages of the world. 

Country codes are defined by ISO 3166 as a two- and three-letter abbreviations for each country or major region in the world.
