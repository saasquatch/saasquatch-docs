> <span class="label">Classic only</span> This error will only be seen in a classic referral program.

### Tips To Fix This

 - Check that you are not accidentally including `isConverted` if the account in question has `paymentProviderId` set.
 - Check that you are not acceidntally submitting a value for `isConverted` or `paymentProviderId` when you don't intend to.

### Why is This Happening?

The `isConverted` parameter is intended for API-only programs only. Conversion of a referral on a Payment Provider Program is acomplished by tracking invoices on a subscription. 

Further details about the complete flow of a referral can be found in our Payment Provider Guides for [Stripe](/developer/stripe/) and [Recurly](/developer/recurly/).
