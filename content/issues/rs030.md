### Tips To Fix This

 - Make sure that each `account_id` has it's own `payment_provider_id`
 - Make sure you're using the right value for `account_id`

### Why is This Happening?

When an account is having its `account_id` changed, then the new `account_id` can not exist in any other account.
You are receiving this error because a different `payment_provider_id` has already had its `account_id` set to the same value as the one you are trying to push.
