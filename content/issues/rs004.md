### Tips To Fix This

 - Make sure to include an `account_id` in your [squatch.js `upsertUser`](/developer/squatchjs/v2/reference/#upsertuser) call.

### Why is This Happening?

The `account_id` parameter is required to help associate the user being created with the correct account, even for Payment Provided integrated programs with `payment_provider_id`s. If you're not sure what to set here our [Shared vs Solo accounts](/shared-vs-solo-accounts) document outlines what value you should use.
