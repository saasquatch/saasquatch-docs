### Tips To Fix This

 - Check that the [`tenant_alias`](/success/navigating-the-portal/#install) you are trying to connect to is correct for the project you are working on.

### Why is This Happening?

It is possible that your code is referencing the `tenant_alias` for a project you were testing on but have since deleted.
