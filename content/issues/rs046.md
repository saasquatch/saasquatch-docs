### Tips To Fix This

 - Make sure the `content-type` your request data is `application/json`.

### Why is This Happening?

Data being sent to SaaSquatch is expected in [JSON](http://www.json.org/) format. Make sure that the data you are sending is formated as JSON and that you include the header `content-type: application/json`.
