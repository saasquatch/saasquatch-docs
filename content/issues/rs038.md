### Tips To Fix This

 - Check that you have included the correct [`tenantAlias`](/success/navigating-the-portal/#install) in your squatch.js calls.
 - Check that your program has not been deleted.

### Why is This Happening?

This error is most commonly due to the incorrect spelling of the tenant alias in your [squatch.js init](/developer/squatchjs/v2/reference/#init).

This error can also be encountered if your project has been deleted. In this case the tenant will no longer exist and thus there will be no tenant found for the tenant alias using in the call.
