### Tips To Fix This

 - Check that you are including a [`checksum` or `JWT`](/topics/json-web-tokens/) if Signed Requests are turned on.
 - Check that you are using the API key (test or live) to match the [correct `tenant_alias`](/success/navigating-the-portal/#install) when signing requests.
 - Check that you are not including client-only parameters like `mode`, and `locale` in your `checksum` or `JWT` calculations.

### Why is This Happening?

This error is most commonly due to an incorrect input to the `checksum` or `JWT` generation or not accidentally excluding the `checksum` or `JWT`.

Check out our [Signed Requests](/squatchjs/signed-requests) page to find out more about when these types of requests are required, how to turn them on/off, and how to generate a `checksum` or `JWT`.
