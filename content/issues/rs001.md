### Tips To Fix This

 - Make sure you're including `payment_provider_id: null`.

### Why is This Happening?

If you've been using SaaSquatch for a long time this error is probably happening because `payment_provider_id` hasn't been included in all of your [squatch.js `upsertUser`](/developer/squatchjs/v2/reference/#upsertuser) calls. At one point it was possible to use only `account_id` but now `payment_provider_id` is a required field. 

If you just recently started using SaaSquatch, then it's most likely that `payment_provider_id` has simply been omitted from your squatch.js `upsertUser` call. The `payment_provider_id` is a required field for all squatch.js calls. Please refer to our [squatch.js `upsertUser`](/developer/squatchjs/v2/reference/#upsertuser) reference for further details on what are required parameters.
