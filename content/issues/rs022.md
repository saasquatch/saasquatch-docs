### Tips To Fix This

 - Use a valid value for `account_status` (one of `PAID`, `TRAIL`, `FREE` or `CANCELLED`)
 - `account_status` is an optional parameter and can be excluded if not explicitly being set.
 - Do not include `account_status` on a Payment Provider program.

### Why is This Happening?

The `account_status` parameter only accepts `PAID`, `TRAIL`, `FREE` or `CANCELLED` as valid options. Make sure that you have not mis-spelled one of these options.

Also it's important to remember that `account_status` is an optional field and can be left out if not being changed. This will leave the value as whatever it was last set to. If you have never set a value then it will default to `TRIAL`.
