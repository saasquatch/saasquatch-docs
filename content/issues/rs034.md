### Tips To Fix This

 - Check that you are including a valid referral code.
 - Check that you are not including the `referralCode` as an empty parameter when you do not plan to set a referral code.

### Why is This Happening?

Setting a custom referral code using squatch.js is limited to 15 ASCII character codes 48-57, 65-90, and 97-122.
