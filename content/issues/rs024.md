### Tips To Fix This

 - Make sure that you include and set the `first_name` parameter in your request.
 - The `first_name` field can only contain ASCII character codes 65-90, and 97-122.

### Why is This Happening?

The `first_name` field is required when you are using the Referral Widget. The field `first_name` was not included, left empty, or includes invalid characters.
