![Short Tags Example](/assets/images/shorttag.png)

The **portal share message editor** lets you change the default messages used for sharing. These messages can include **short tags** and [template fields](/themes/fields) as [Handlebars](http://handlebarsjs.com/)-style variables to make it easy to include dynamic data in your widget messaging. Some popular short codes examples are `{{referralcode}}` and `{{twittersharelink}}`. All short tags are aliases to longer commonly used template fields and simplify things like  converting cents to dollars. Check out the developer reference at the bottom of this page for complete details.
