title: Custom Short Domain Guide
highlights: Referral SaaSquatch supports the use of Custom Short Domains which allow you to change the format of the referral links shared by your users. Instead of the standard link format ([ssqt.co/barYS](http://ssqt.co/barYS)) you can create your own ([referral.your-domain.com/barYS](http://referral.your-domain.com/barYS)).

### Requirements:

The main requirement for being able to make use of Custom Short Domains is having access to a dedicated domain or subdomain for use with the referral program. The domain you want to use for Custom Short Domains cannot already be in use. 

For example, if you are already using your-domain.com for your website, you cannot re-use this as your Custom Short Domain. 

Instead, you could use a subdomain like [referral.your-domain.com](referral.your-domain.com) or [share.your-domain.com](share.your-domain.com). You can also make use of another domain like [your-domain.io](your-domain.io) or [your-domain.ca](your-domain.ca).

### Step 1: Pick your Domain
Confirm which domain or subdomain you want to use, making sure that it conforms to the restrictions outlined above. 

### Step 2: Setup Domain A Record
Point the A Record of the domain you will be using to Referral SaaSquatch. Please contact Support to get the correct IP address for this step.

A change to a domain’s A Record can take anywhere from minutes all the way up  to 24 hour to take effect. If after 24 hours there is still no change then the A Record was not changed correctly and is not pointing at our IP address.

### Step 3: Testing A Record Change
Before we continue with the setup of your Custom Short Domains we need to confirm that the domain’s A Record has been correctly changed to point to our IP address.

To test whether the A Record has been changed correctly take a working referral link from your program with the existing Referral SaaSquatch Short Domain, like [ssqt.co/barY](http://ssqt.co/barYS), and remove our domain and substitute in your own. This should leave you with a URL that looks something like [referral.your-domain.com/barYS](http://referral.your-domain.com/barYS).

If this new link takes you to the landing page that was set for the tenant then your A Record is correctly setup. If the link does not take you to your tenant’s landing page allow for the full 24 hours needed to reflect the A Record change. If after 24 hours  the link still doesn’t work then the A Record has not been set correctly.

### Step 4: Inform SaaSquatch
Only once the A Record is setup correctly we can make the necessary changes on our end to move forward with setting up your Custom Short Domain. 

Make sure you have correctly completed Step 3 otherwise all the links generated going forward will be broken.

With the A Record set correctly, contact a member of the success team with the Custom Short Domain you wish to use so that SaaSquatch can change your program to make use of this Custom Short Domain.

Referral SaaSquatch will notify you when the changes on our end are complete and another step of setting up your Custom Short Domains is completed.

### Step 5: Verify

As a precaution, we will make the change to the new Custom Short Domains on the Test tenant before making changes to the Live Tenant. 

Confirm with a member of the Referral SaaSquatch Success team that the new links in your Test tenant are being generated correctly.

### Step 6: Launch!
With confirmation from you that the new links in the Test tenant are working we will push the Custom Short Domain changes to the Live tenant. 

You are now live with your own Custom Short Domains, Congratulations!

#### Please note: 

Existing referral links in the wild that make use of our short domain, like [ssqt.co/barYS](http://ssqt.co/barYS), will still work as they always have. The change is that new links being generated, or exposed in the widget, will be with the Custom Short Domain you have chosen.
