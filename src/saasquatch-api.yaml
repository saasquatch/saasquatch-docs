  title: Referral SaaSquatch REST API Reference
  description: |
    The Referral SaaSquatch API is organized around REST. Our API is designed to have predictable, resource-oriented URLs and to use HTTP response codes to indicate API errors. We use built-in HTTP features, like HTTP authentication and HTTP verbs, which can be understood by off-the-shelf HTTP clients. JSON will be returned in all responses from the API, including errors.

    To make the Referral SaaSquatch API as explorable as possible, accounts have test-mode API keys as well as live-mode API keys. These keys are both active at the same time. Data created with test-mode credentials will use your payment system's respective test mode.

        This method creates or updates a User object by performing an atomic upsert operation. Using this method will either replace the information stored about a given user, or
        create a new user if no User with a matching `id` is found. This method is helpful for synchronizing user information from your database into Referral SaaSquatch.
        This method will not create or update the Account linked by `accountId`. When creating users for the first time ensure that the Account already exists or create it before using this call.

        Gets the share links for a user. Share links are the links that people use to refer their friends and are the same links used in the Referral SaaSquatch widgets. The main
        use case for this method is to look up share links to include in other channels like email marketing, CRM and product integration when a widget or mobile webview can't be
        easily used. For example, one could write "Share this link with your friends, and get rewarded when they sign up" and include the share link looked up using this method.

        All share links work by dropping a tracking cookie when someone clicks the link and redirecting the new user to a landing page. This cookie includes the value of the
        referral code of the person that shared it. The cookie
        can be read using the `autofill` function of Squatch.js and is also passed along as the `rsCode` parameter in the redirect.
        For example `http://ssqt.co/pZVp` redirects to `https://www.google.ca/?rsCode=THIRDUSER`.

        There are many share links for each user, each one tagged with additional metadata for tracking the effectiveness of sharing channels. For example the `facebookShareLink` is used in the
        share on Facebook functionality of the widget. When people share on facebook using the widget that `facebookShareLink` will be posted on their wall so that when new people click on that
        link they will be tracked as a referral and attributed back to Facebook. Note that this does not necessarily guarantee tracking; the generic `shareLink` could simply be copied
        and pasted on to Facebook, and due to limitation on http referer information passed on by browsers, it may not be possible to determine which share medium a new sign up came from.

        In some cases it is preferable to have users share their referral code with friends instead of sharing their referral link. For example mobile apps and cookie blocking may prevent
        a share link from successfully tracking a referral, and having an input box for "Referral Code" on your product sign up form gets around these limitations and will ensure that more
        types of referrals can be tracked. Use the [Lookup a user API call](#get_user) to find a user's referral code.

        This API method returns the full list of referral share links for a user. Optional filter parameters are available to return only links of a specific share or engagement medium.

        Share links are made available to a Referrer to provide to their friends and family to click and be directed to your referral program landing page.

        The sharelinks are segmented by Engagement Medium, which is the channel the Referrer accessed the program to be able to share out their referral through. For each Engagment Medium, like `EMBED`, a link is provided for each available Share Medium. This segmentation is used to power the [SaaSquatch analytics platform](/features/analytics/) to provide information about how, and where, your users are interacting with your referral program.
        For example, The `WHATSAPP` link from the `MOBILE` section is intended to be used to indicated to our system that the Referrer accessed the referral program from a mobile device and shared their referral with their friend using Whatsapp. More information about available [Engagement Mediums](/success/touchpoints/) and [Share Mediums](/success/share-options/) can be found in our success center.

        Share links work by dropping a tracking cookie in the user's browser when the user clicks the link and is directed to your referral program's landing page. This cookie includes the referral code of the Referrer that shared it. Once on your website this cookie can be read using the squatch.js [autofill](/developer/squatchjs/v2/#3-autofill-the-referral-code) method and is also automatically picked up by our squatch.js library to connect referrals.

        The referral code is also passed along to your referral program landing page as the URL parameter `rsCode`. For example `http://ssqt.co/pZVp` redirects to `https://www.google.ca/?rsCode=JOHNDOE`.

        Moderation can apply to one side of a referral, the other side, or both sides (Referrer and Referred).
        When a referral is denied, the associated reward will be "cancelled".
        A referral can be moderated several times, subsequently cancelling and un-cancelling the associated reward or rewards, and can be done as long as the associated reward is `cancellable`.
        Some rewards such as the coupons automatically generated by Referral SaaSquatch into Stripe and Recurly are not `cancellable` and requests to change the moderation will error.

        This API method returns the full list of referral share links for a user. Optional filter parameters are available to return only links of a specific share or engagement medium.

        Share links are made available to a Referrer to provide to their friends and family to click and be directed to your referral program landing page.

        The sharelinks are segmented by Engagement Medium, which is the channel the Referrer accessed the program to be able to share out their referral through. For each Engagment Medium, like `EMBED`, a link is provided for each available Share Medium. This segmentation is used to power the [SaaSquatch analytics platform](/features/analytics/) to provide information about how, and where, your users are interacting with your referral program.
        For example, The `WHATSAPP` link from the `MOBILE` section is intended to be used to indicated to our system that the Referrer accessed the referral program from a mobile device and shared their referral with their friend using Whatsapp. More information about available [Engagement Mediums](/success/touchpoints/) and [Share Mediums](/success/share-options/) can be found in our success center.

        Share links work by dropping a tracking cookie in the user's browser when the user clicks the link and is directed to your referral program's landing page. This cookie includes the referral code of the Referrer that shared it. Once on your website this cookie can be read using the squatch.js [autofill](/developer/squatchjs/v2/#3-autofill-the-referral-code) method and is also automatically picked up by our squatch.js library to connect referrals.

        The referral code is also passed along to your referral program landing page as the URL parameter `rsCode`. For example `http://ssqt.co/pZVp` redirects to `https://www.google.ca/?rsCode=JOHNDOE`.

        Creates an asynchronous request for an Exports. Depending on the size of the Export and other exports in the export pipeline, it may take awhile for an
        export request to complete. Once the Export is completed, it can be downloaded in the requested format (CSV or zipped XLSX) using the download url endpoint.

        Here are a few ways to check for when an export is ready.

        - **Polling** - While an export is being prepared you can check the status using the `id`. Make sure you store the `id` of the export when you request it.
        - **Webhooks** - When an export is complete, a webhook event will be fired. Make sure you create a webhook endpoint subscription before you create your export.
        - **Listing** - You can use the API to list recent exports, and check their status.

        - name: export
