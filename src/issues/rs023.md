### Tips To Fix This

 - Make sure that the email address is atleast 7 charactes long
 - The email address must have characters before the @ symbol
 - The Top Level Domain needs to be at least 2 characters (.ca for example)

### Why is This Happening?

The email address SaaSquatch receives seems to be invalid. Please verify that the email address you are sending through [Squatch.js](/squatchjs/) is an existing email address. 

If you believe that the email address is valid and you still get this error, please [contact us](mailto:support@saasquat.ch?Subject=RS023%20Invalid%20Email%20Address). It would be helpful to include your `tenant_alias` and the `email` that doesn't validate.
