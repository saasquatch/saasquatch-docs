### Tips To Fix This

 - [Login to your SaaSquatch portal](https://app.referralsaasquatch.com) to lookup your `tenant_alias` on the Install page.

### Why is This Happening?

A `tenant_alias` is how we can identify your referral program from the other companies using SaaSquatch. 

The error is most commonly the result of a mis-typed `tenant_alias` when configuring your squatch.js call.
