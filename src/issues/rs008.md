### Tips To Fix This

 - Make sure the `payment_provider_id` is a valid Recurly Account ID
 - Make sure the `payment_provider_id` is from the Live or Test Recurly Gateway that matches the Live or Test `tenant_alias` that you're using in Referral SaaSquatch.
 - If the user does not yet exist in Reculy set `payment_provider_id: null`
 - If the Referral SaaSquatch Account already has a `payment_provider_id` associated with it you must include that value, not `null`.

### Why is This Happening?

We validate any `payment_provider_id` by using it to [look up a Recurly Account with a matching Account Code](https://docs.recurly.com/api/accounts#get-account). If you're running into this issue, it means that we couldn't find a Recurly account using the `payment_provider_id` that you provided. 

If some of your users don't exist in Recurly, then you can set `payment_provider_id: null` for those users.
