### Tips To Fix This

 - Check that multiple referral participants are not incorrectly registered under the same account. 
 - Check that server-side calls being made to Referral SaaSquatch are done so using an API key for authentication and not a JWT. 

### Why is This Happening?

For security purposes client-side requests to Referral SaaSquatch are rate-limited when using a JWT for authentication.
