### Tips To Fix This

 - Make sure the `payment_provider_id` is a valid Braintree Customer ID
 - Make sure the `payment_provider_id` is from the Braintree Production or Sandbox mode that matches the Live or Test `tenant_alias` that you're using in Referral SaaSquatch.
 - If the user does not yet exist in Braintree, set `payment_provider_id: null`
 - If the Referral SaaSquatch Account already has a `payment_provider_id` associated with it you must include that value, not `null`.


### Why is This Happening?

We immediately validate any `payment_provider_id` by using it to look up a Braintree Customer with a matching Customer ID. If you're running into this issue it means that we couldn't find a Braintree Customer using the `payment_provider_id` that you provided. 

If some of your users don't exist in Braintree, then you can set `payment_provider_id: null` for those users.
