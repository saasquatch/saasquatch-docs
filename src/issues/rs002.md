### Tips To Fix This

 - Make sure to include a `checksum` or `JWT`

### Why is This Happening?

When you're using a javascript library like squatch.js, the calls are visible in the client-side webpage code. With this information it could be possible for someone to manipulate requests your site is making to Referral SaaSquatch. For example, someone could potentially abuse your system by setting `account_status: "PAID"` and generate an un-earned reward. 

To prevent this, we require a `checksum` or `JWT` as a security measure. As part of generating this `checksum` or `JWT` on your server you use your Referral SaaSquatch API key which is not available in the client-side code. This means requests to our system with a correct `checksum` or `JWT` can be confirmed to have come from an approved source.

Check out our [Signed Requests](/squatchjs/signed-requests) page to find out more about when these types of requests are required, how to turn them on/off, and how to generate a `checksum` or `JWT`.
