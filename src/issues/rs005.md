### Tips To Fix This

 - Make sure to include a `checksum` or `JWT`
 - Turn [Signed Requests](/squatchjs/signed-requests) off.

### Why is This Happening?

For security reasons you must always include a `checksum` or `JWT` when secure mode is enabled.

Check out our [Signed Requests](/squatchjs/signed-requests) page to find out more about when these types of requests are required, how to turn them on/off, and how to generate a `checksum` or `JWT`.
