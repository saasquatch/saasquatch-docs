### Tips To Fix This

 - Make sure the `payment_provider_id` is a valid Zuora Account ID
 - Make sure the `payment_provider_id` is from the Zuora Live or Test gateway that matches the Live or Test `tenant_alias` that you're using in Referral SaaSquatch.
 - If the user does not yet exist in Zuora, set `payment_provider_id: null`
 - If the Referral SaaSquatch Account already has a `payment_provider_id` associated with it you must include that value, not `null`.

### Why is This Happening?

We immediately validate any `payment_provider_id` by using it to look up a Zuora Account with a matching Account ID. If you're running into this issue it means that we couldn't find a Zuora Account using the `payment_provider_id` that you provided. 

If some of your users don't exist in Zuora, then you can set `payment_provider_id: null` for those users.
