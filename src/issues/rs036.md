### Tips To Fix This

 - Check that you are including a valid value for widgetType. These include `REFERRER_WIDGET` and `CONVERSION_WIDGET`.

### Why is This Happening?

`REFERRER_WIDGET` and `CONVERSION_WIDGET` are currently the two types of widgets that can be displayed using the widgetType pamrameter in our squatch.js V2 Library.

More information about the widgetType parameter can be found in our [squatch.js Library Reference](/developer/squatchjs/v2/reference/).
