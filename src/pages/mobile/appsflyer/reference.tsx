The SaaSquatch integration with AppsFlyer works as follows:

* SaaSquatch sharelinks will start redirecting to AppsFlyer links

UPDATE ME FOR NEW FIELDS
* SaaSquatch will create AppsFlyer links dynamically by appending custom attribution parameters to the link provided in your AppsFlyer configuration.
  * These links will have data for: \`af_web_dp\`, \`utm_source\`, \`utm_medium\`, \`utm_campaign\`, \`rsCode\`, \`rsShareMedium\`, \`rsEngagementMedium\` and \`_saasquatch\`
  
  * You can use \`_saasquatch\` to attribute referrals and the other parameters to customize the mobile landing experience.

SaaSquatch will redirect all link clicks through AppsFlyer. Mobile users will be directed by AppsFlyer according to your OneLink configuration and desktop users will be directed to the landing page URL you configured for your SaaSquatch program. SaaSquatch passes this URL through the \`af_web_dp\` parameter. If you set the value for \`af_web_dp\` in AppsFlyer it will overwrite the value configured for your SaaSquatch program.

__IMPORTANT:__ If you have both Branch Metrics and AppsFlyer integrations enabled, share links will still be redirected to AppsFlyer links, however the Branch deep link will be passed to the AppsFlyer integration instead of your landing page link (in effect, both integrations are applied, Branch first, then AppsFlyer).

### Example Deep Link

When SaaSquatch creates AppsFlyer links dynamically the resulting link and itâ€™s custom attribution parameters produce a deep link similar to the following example:

    "utm_campaign": "saasquatch",

There may be other parameters added by AppsFlyer depending on how your OneLink is configured.

### Data Fields

When SaaSquatch creates AppsFlyer links dynamically, it includes a number of custom attribution parameters. These includes fields from AppsFlyer, as well as the standard set of parameters usually passed in the query string to your program landing page by SaaSquatch. The fields are detailed below.
