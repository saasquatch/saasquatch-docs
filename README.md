# SaaSquatch Documentation

[![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.org/saasquatch/saasquatch-docs.png)](https://travis-ci.org/saasquatch/saasquatch-docs) [![Dependency Status](https://david-dm.org/saasquatch/saasquatch-docs.svg)](https://david-dm.org/saasquatch/saasquatch-docs)

We decided to make the [SaaSquatch documentation](http://docs.saasquatch.com/) site an open source project so that we could share the work that we do with people in our community.
